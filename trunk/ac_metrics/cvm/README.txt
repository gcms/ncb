* Always work with your local copy. Test, test and test. once you are confident your code works, then go ahead and commit.

* Do not modify files you are not responsible for.

* If there is a need to modify a file you are not responsible for, ask the person who is responsible for the file to implement the changes. DO NOT DO IT YOURSELF!

* Always send a message to the group whenever you commit new code so that we all know about the changes.
